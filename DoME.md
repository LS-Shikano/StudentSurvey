# ToDo
Three waves: Nomvember/ December/ January 

alten survey durchschauen wegen fragen die entfernt werden können 
    niedrige varianz
    niedrige response rate 

network among student + performance (build up this area)

## Code Generation and Distribution 

1. Sign up for an anonymous code by registering yourself on a sheet (matrikelnummer - survey code)
2. Exchange your code with other students whom you know 
3. take a memo for all information above. keep it until the end of the semester 

- Löwenstein Distance for code generation 
- liste mit random codes (3-stellige) manuell ausgegeben (Option!!!)
- hashfunktion mit matrikelnummer / personalisiert 


## Vignette App
- [Vignette App Blueprint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRRiqEtoOX3URnHSSgDCcNFG5OksqOhchNA4S4MAbEc/edit?tab=t.0)

- Opinion or fact
- is there a narrotor
- what are the sides to be believed
	- Parents
	- school
	- teacher
	- child

## Project Expansion Ideas
- Student Survey Pipeline 
- Full Data Pipeline for Cleaning 
- Network Analysis 
	- Visualizations
	- Metrics and Hypothesis testing 
		- Homophily 
	- Time Analysis 
	- Multiplex analysis 
	- Link Predictions 

## Cleaning 
- Fix missing value problem 
	- 'keine Angabe' to -999
	- missing values are filled with 0 or -999?
*Probably better to leave this for now so there is not more confusion and then change it for next year*

## Survey
- participantscodes nicer solution not scrolling hell
- [Preventing Duplicates in OTree](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/tips_and_tricks.html#many-fields)
- _Add latency as meta variable_

## Analysis 
- Homophily related to politics and other attributes and connected to other relations 
	- comparison of different homophilies and which ones are stronger -> which edges get build -> influence on attributes 
	- Poliicial Angle
	- Academical/ Achievement Angle 
	- Efficacy and Centrality - Are people who are sure of themselves and where are they placed in the network 
- Termeh Shafi - Analysis Multiplex Network 
- Persuasion over Time, So change in Attributes from W1, W2, W3 
- Sommer Semester and Presentation: June/July

## Third Wave
**Deadline: last week january**
- **remove redundant information from previous waves???**
- setting up two instances if one of them fails!!!
