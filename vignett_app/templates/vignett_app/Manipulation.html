<h3>Vignette Experiment</h3>
<p>
    A <strong>{{ player.part1 }}</strong> reported to <strong>{{ player.part6 }}</strong> parents that the instructor of
    a <strong>{{ player.part3 }}</strong> class in a <strong>{{ player.part4 }}</strong> <strong>{{ player.part10 }}</strong>
    <strong>{{ player.part11 }}</strong>  
    The parents alerted a parent
    representative to discuss with the <strong>{{ player.part4 }}</strong>â€™s director as well as the other
    representatives to prevent such an incident. The director refused to do anything since the <strong>{{ player.part3
        }}</strong> class was organized by an external <strong>{{ player.part3 }}</strong> school. Thereafter, all the
    other parents remained uninformed about this incident.
</p>
<p>
    After several months, a child in the same <strong>{{ player.part4 }}</strong> was exposed to the same <strong>{{
        player.part8 }}</strong>. 
        
        <strong>{{ player.part12 }}</strong> parents happened to hear about the incident during
    the <strong>{{ player.part3 }}</strong> class in the past and approached a member of the <strong>{{ player.part4 }}</strong> management,
    who also met the instructor after the incident. Accordingly, the instructor admitted <strong>{{ player.part2
        }}</strong> behavior, but without any evil intention. Based on this, the <strong>{{ player.part4 }}</strong> saw
    the problem being solved and did not take any further actions. The parents of the <strong>{{ player.part7
        }}</strong> child asked the director to approach the <strong>{{ player.part3 }}</strong> school to correct the
    situation. However, <strong>{{ player.part9 }}</strong> refused to do it and asked them to talk with the <strong>{{
        player.part3 }}</strong> school for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    In a meeting with the parents the <strong>{{ player.part3 }}</strong> school said that there was no such an incident
    and the instructor only stopped the children from making <strong>{{ player.part8 }}</strong> during the class. The
    director also said that there is a testimony of the instructor, which however they did not make available to the
    parents. <strong>{{ player.part5 }}</strong> further accused the parents of causing reputation damage based only on
    a statement of a <strong>{{ player.part1 }}</strong> several months ago.
